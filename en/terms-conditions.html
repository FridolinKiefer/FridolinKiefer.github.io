In order for the User to be able to effectively access the sections reserved for Users, he or she must proceed to prior registration using the available registration form. Once registered, the User will have a username or &quot;login&quot; and a &quot;password&quot;, which make up the access code that will allow him/her to be identified as a registered User and authorized to access confidential information relating to the private area of the Web/Platform and/or the App. Also, to access as a User you must identify yourself in the section of the Web/Platform and/or the App enabled for this purpose with your username and password.

<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Subscriptions that you purchased with your account can be cancelled at any time. </strong></p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>If you cannot access the content, we can send you a refund, depending on the details of the service and the performance issue.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>If you cancel your subscription within the first 48 hours of a monthly subscription (or longer subscription), we may refund the cost of the month of cancellation.</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: We can only send refunds for active subscriptions (we will not refund the amount of subscriptions that have already expired).</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>BRAINITY offers all Users a 14-day trial period to use the service free of charge. Your payment details will not be requested until the end of the trial period. At the end of your 14-day free trial, this subscription will automatically roll into a paid-for ongoing subscription with a recurring monthly subscription fee. Subscription duration will be ongoing until cancellation. If you want to prevent this, you can cancel your subscription prior to the end of the free 14-day trial period. However, if you do cancel, you can continue to use the free trial until the 14-day trial period ends. Once the trial rolls into a paid for subscription, you can cancel your subscription at any time, so that your subscription will expire at the end of the then current month. This will stop future payments of the subscription fees but you will not receive a refund for payments already made, unless otherwise stated in these Terms and Conditions or in the particular terms and conditions. When you cancel a subscription, you will still have access to your subscription for the remainder of time you have already paid for.&nbsp;</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Uninstalling an app will not automatically stop your subscription. You must cancel your subscription to end your subscription. If you uninstall the app without cancelling your subscription, you will still be charged.&nbsp;If an app you&#39;ve purchased a subscription for is removed, your future subscription will be automatically cancelled but past subscriptions will not be refunded.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>In no event will BRAINITY be liable for the fraudulent use of the services by any User of the Web/Platform and/or the App.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: The cancellation and refund policy is different for the Facebook service, which is a separate service from ours. Therefore, the User understands that the investment made in Facebook will not be refunded when cancelling our service. However, if by mistake we have caused the User to spend a higher budget on advertisements than the one indicated and approved, we will not charge you for our service until we have compensated you for the additional expenses. If you would rather receive a refund for the additional expenses, you can email us at <a href="mailto:hello@brainity.co">hello@brainity.co</a> or <a href="mailto:legal@brainity.co">legal@brainity.co</a>.</strong></p>
