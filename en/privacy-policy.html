<p dir="ltr"><strong>We may also release your personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, protect our own and third-party rights, or for safety reasons. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Nevertheless, BRAINITY ensures the safeguard of the confidentiality and safety of the personal data at all times, having adopted the legally required safety measures, which allow us to reasonably ensure the protection of your personal data and prevent the loss, misuse, alteration, processing or unauthorized access of them.</strong></p>

&nbsp;</p>

<h5 dir="ltr"><strong>6. RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, CANCELLATION AND OPPOSITION</strong></h5>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>The User may exercise his or her rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition by sending a written communication to the address Casa Joan Teula (Viladordis) 08240 &ndash; Manresa (Barcelona, Spain), or by sending a copy of his or her national identity card or passport to <a href="mailto:legal@brainity.co">legal@brainity.co</a>.</strong></p>


<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Such communication shall contain the following information:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Name and surname of the User.</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Petition in which the request is based.</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Address for notification purposes, date and User&#39;s signature.</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Documents certifying the request made, if applicable.</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>BRAINITY informs Users that the exercise of these rights is very personal, so that only the User himself may exercise these rights with respect to the personal data of which he is the legitimate owner. Nevertheless, and in the cases in which it is exceptionally admitted, the legal representative of the User may exercise the rights of the User in the terms set out above, provided that he accompanies the aforementioned communication with the document certifying such representation.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>By providing their personal data, the User states and ensures that they are accurate, complete, truthful and up to date, leaving BRAINITY free from any liability that may arise as a result of the breach of such obligation.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>If the User is a minor or incapable, BRAINITY warns of the need to have the consent of their parents, guardians or legal representatives for the communication of their personal data, so BRAINITY forbids a minor or incapable to provide their data or use the Web/Platform and/or the App if he/she does not have the consent of their parents, guardians or legal representatives, not being otherwise BRAINITY responsible for the actions of the minor or incapable.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Except in the fields in which it is expressly determined otherwise, the answers to the questions on personal data are voluntary, without the lack of an answer to such questions implying a decrease in the quality of the services you request. Failure to fill in the fields identified as mandatory or the provision of incorrect data will make it impossible for BRAINITY to provide the services requested.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Also, in the search for total transparency in its relationship with the User, BRAINITY informs you of the use of other computer mechanisms related to personal data, such as cookies and logs on this Web/Platform and the App.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Cookies are a message sent by the server to the User&#39;s computer, consisting of text files that are stored in the computer&#39;s memory and collect information regarding the pages visited, the time of Internet connection, etc. Cookies are sent back to the server each time the User enters that page. This Web/Platform will adapt the information managed and its purpose to the provisions of article 22 of the LSSI 34/2002, in accordance with RDL 13/2012, of 30 March.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>The purpose of BRAINITY&#39;s cookies is to personalize the services we offer, providing you with information that may be of interest to you. If you do not want a cookie to be installed on your hard drive, you can set your computer&#39;s browser not to receive them. However, we would like to point out that, in any case, the quality of the Web/Platform and the App operation may decrease.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Cookies are only associated with an anonymous User and his or her computer, and do not by themselves provide the personal data of the customer, nor can they read data from his or her hard drive, nor read cookie files created by other providers. You can find more information about the cookies we use, their purpose and other information of interest at the following link: Cookies Policy.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Logs are files stored on the BRAINITY&#39;s server that record data about your browsing and whose main purpose is to gather information about the operations carried out by you. They also allow us to continue providing you with the services you request, to better understand your preferences and to offer you other services that may suit your tastes. They also help us to analyze the functioning of the system, locate incidents and problems that may arise, and resolve them as quickly as possible.</strong></p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h5 dir="ltr"><strong>7. RIGHTS OF LIMITATION OF TREATMENT, WITHDRAWAL AND PORTABILITY</strong></h5>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>The User also has a right to limit the processing of personal data, a right to delete and transfer personal data transmitted to the data controller.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>In compliance with current legislation, BRAINITY informs that the data will be kept for the period of time strictly necessary to comply with the above-mentioned provisions.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Unless you inform us otherwise, we will understand that your data has not been modified, that you agree to notify us of any changes and that we have your consent to use your data for the purposes mentioned above.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>BRAINITY informs that it will treat the data in a lawful, fair, transparent, adequate, relevant, limited, accurate and up-to-date manner. That is why BRAINITY commits itself to take all reasonable steps to ensure that these are deleted or rectified without delay if they are inaccurate.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5 dir="ltr"><strong>8. THIRD PARTY LINKS</strong></h5>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h5 dir="ltr"><strong>9. SUGGESTIONS TO USERS</strong></h5>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>BRAINITY advises Users to use the latest versions of the software, given the integration of greater safety measures.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>BRAINITY also advises Users to use the safety mechanisms available to them (secure Web servers, cryptography, digital signature, firewall, etc.) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of their data as necessary.</strong></p>


<p dir="ltr"><strong>BRAINITY reminds Users that the Internet is not always safe and they must take the necessary and appropriate technical measures to prevent unauthorized processing of their data.</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>This Privacy Policy may also be amended by any other general clauses or conditions of access to certain services, in the event that such access involves a specific area of expertise in the protection of personal data. In any case, these special features will not be applicable to your personal data as long as the User does not accept the above clauses or statements.</strong></p>
